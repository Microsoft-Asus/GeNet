      "An interview with art director for GRODT; Julian Alexander  What was 50s original vision for the cover?  Julian Alexander: He wanted to have shattered glass. And I kind of envisioned it as a doorway  a shattered full glass door. And what you would see was a bullet hole in the glass and you would see his hand leaning on the glass. His posture would be kind of kneeling over  like hes leaning on the glass for support. So youd see this bullet hole, a shattered glass with a hand on it and there was gonna be blood drippin down from his hand. You wouldnt see his face, but you would see a slumped figure and blood on the hand. You would read that this person had been shot, but theyre still standing.    So how did it change from that initial idea to what the Get Rich Or Die Tryin cover eventually ended up being?   Julian Alexander: Well, I went home and put together a creative brief based on what he wanted. [And I thought], how are we going to tell this whole story? I felt that [the original] cover [concept], while its very sophisticated, only represented the Die Tryin part of the title. It didnt represent the Get Rich at all. So I thought How are we gonna bring some sort of balance?  I spoke to 50 and Nicole Frantz and suggested Lets keep the shattered glass, but lets switch it up a little bit.  What we ended up with for the album cover I feel represents [the fuller story]. Hes standing up, hes standing strong behind that shattered glass. Almost as if hes kind of bullet proof. Like hes kind of bounced back. And when you look at the center of the bullet hole, you see [that hes wearing] this diamond cross. Hes got this Gucci holster on and diamond belt buckle. So to me that part represents Get Rich.       What do you remember about 50s demeanor during the shoot?  Julian Alexander: I think he was just eager to do it. Physically before this album shoot, 50 was a bigger person. He wasnt cut up. I remember the first time I saw him after he had been shot, he came to Sony and was like, Yeah man, the dudes who shot me they put me on Super Slim Fast. [laughs] He lifted up his shirt to show me how he had been workin out. Because he was just eager to get [his] body [in shape]. It was something he chose to do for himself, but he was eager to show it off. And he just envisioned [success] comin for him. And [this was part of how] he prepared himself for it. You always got the sense that this was a moment for him, yknow what I mean? And he was not lettin it pass.    Okay, so youre at the photoshoot and you started off [shooting] these portraits behind the glass. Was the glass really there?      Julian Alexander: When we planned on doing this, I spoke with [the prop stylist] and I said, Look we are gonna shoot this cover behind glass and I dont know how youre gonna do it but I need you to shoot a piece of glass   Hes like, I can do it! and said that he could simulate a shattered glass effect with plexiglass. He could drill a hole and crack it in a way where it could look like a bullet had been shot through real glass.  You sure its gonna work? I said.   And hes like, Yeah its gonna work, I promise.   Aight. So we get to the shoot and the first thing that I wanna see is the plexiglass and it looks like [a sheet of] plexiglass with a drilled hole in it.  He tried. Its not like it was just some throwaway thing and he didnt put effort into it, but it wasnt what it needed to be. So I said, Look, you gotta go shoot the glass. So he left. How he shot that glass was a mystery to all of us. If I remember correctly, he went to a gun range. He may have used a friends gun, but it definitely wasnt provided by 50 or anyone else that was on set. When he came back with the glass, we didnt have much time to discuss it because we were shooting, I was just happy that he got it done.     He brought back the glass, Sacha put it in front of the camera, and he photographed 50 through the shattered glass. We also shot the glass separately, we shot 50 separately. And the image ended up being a composite of all these things. If you look in the center areas, youll see parts where you see 50s skin, you see him and its a little blurred through the glass.
